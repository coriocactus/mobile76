{- 
  Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence
  is generated by adding the previous two terms.
  By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 ...
  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence
  whose values do not exceed four million,
  find the sum of the even-valued terms.
